# ContainerLabPy

This directory contains example fixtures for Docker Compose integration tests.

Fixtures are used to provide reusable Compose files and configurations for testing container orchestration features.

## Usage

- Place Compose YAML files and related resources in this directory.
- Reference fixtures in your integration tests to simulate real-world Compose scenarios.

## Structure

- Each fixture should be self-contained and documented.
- Add new fixtures as needed for additional test cases.

## Example

See `docker-compose.yml` files and supporting scripts for sample setups.
