# ContainerLabPy

This directory contains example fixtures for container images used in integration tests.

Image fixtures provide reusable Docker images and configurations for testing container lifecycle, networking, and orchestration features.

## Usage

- Place Dockerfiles, image scripts, and related resources in this directory.
- Reference fixtures in your tests to simulate real-world image scenarios.

## Structure

- Each fixture should be self-contained and documented.
- Add new fixtures as needed for additional test cases.

## Example

See sample Dockerfiles and scripts for custom test images.
